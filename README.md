# Student-Enrollment-Form

Description :-
The Student Form project is a web application that allows users to fill out a form to enroll students. The form collects information such as Roll No, Full Name, Class, Birth Date, Address, and Enrollment Date. The data is stored in the STUDENT-TABLE relation of the SCHOOL-DB database using JsonPowerDB.
